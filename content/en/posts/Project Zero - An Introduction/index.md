## Introduction

For the past few weeks, I have been eager to start a personal project. My journey of learning Python has been fuelled by [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/) 🐍, and throughout this learning process, I've been maintaining a list of potential project ideas. Now, before I dive into the specifics of what I’ll be building, I want to take some time to discuss my overall approach and the guiding principles I intend to follow.

## Project Approach **🛠️**

My goal is to approach this project in a way that mirrors real-world software development practices as closely as possible - at least, those that I have seen an experienced. These include:

- **Planning and backlog creation 📋:** Although a Software Engineer (SWE) might not typically handle backlog creation in a professional environment, I find it valuable to experience the entire process.
- **Story-pointing and grooming 🧹:** Estimating the effort required for each feature and refining them over time will help me better understand scope management.
- **Technical decision-making 🤔:** I'll need to make critical choices regarding architecture, tools, and frameworks.
- **Development and testing ✅:** Writing clean, maintainable code and ensuring it works as expected through testing.
- **Iterative improvements 🔄:** Regular reflection on progress and adjusting my approach as needed.

By simulating these aspects, I believe I can achieve a well-rounded learning experience that extends beyond just writing code.

## My Background **🎯**

In my previous role as a Product Manager, I gained significant experience in planning, strategic analysis, and understanding user needs and requirements. My skill set includes:

- **Effective planning 📅:** Breaking down complex tasks into manageable components.
- **Analytical thinking 📊:** Developing data-driven strategies and making informed decisions.
- **User-focused mindset 👥:** Prioritizing features that deliver value to end users.
- **Roadmap creation 🛤️:** Structuring development efforts to align with long-term goals.

I hope to leverage these skills in my project, but importantly, want to hone my coding skills learnt up until this point.

## **Documenting the Journey 📝**

As you can tell by now, To make this journey even more meaningful, I’m planning to maintain a diary or blog to document my experiences. Although I want this to be read by others and enjoyed by others, it is also for me. For me to look back on and understand the mistake’s I’ve made and the progress achieved. 

I’m planning that each blog entry will cover different aspects of the project, such as challenges encountered, lessons learned, and insights gained along the way. At the end of the project, I will conduct a retrospective to evaluate:

- **What went well ✅:** Key successes and highlights.
- **What could be improved ⚠️:** Areas where I struggled and possible solutions.
- **Future improvements 🔧:** Changes I would implement in future projects.

As I say, all of this content will be shared publicly, in the hope that it may provide value to others, whether they're beginners looking for inspiration or experienced developers interested in different approaches. To keep things from spiralling into essays, I’ll aim to make my posts concise, informative and to the point.

## **Time Commitment ⏳**

I am allocating approximately **40 hours** for the development phase of the project. Is this enough? Too much? I’m unsure, but it seems like a reasonable estimate based on the complexity of my chosen idea. In total, I anticipate spending around **60 hours**, including planning, writing, and reflecting.

My goal is to stay consistent and disciplined while maintaining flexibility to adjust if needed.

## Next Steps **🚀**

In the next blog post, I’ll reveal the project idea and dive into the planning phase. Stay tuned!
