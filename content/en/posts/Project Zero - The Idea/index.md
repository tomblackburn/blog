## The Idea💡

 I've been bouncing around ideas for a while, trying to figure out what my first project should be. I spent too much time weighing options, so I finally decided to go with the one that seemed the most fun...

**🎯 A Discord Bot!**

## Why? 🤔

I'm quite an avid reader. A while back, I was part of an online book club where members nominated and voted on a book to read each month, followed by a discussion at the end. This community used a Discord server.

📚 The server was pretty basic, with just one bot to manage introductions and agreements to the server rules. I forget which one it was, maybe MEE6.

I wanted a way to easily share my **TBR (To-Be-Read)** list with other members when they asked what I was currently reading or planning to read. Imagine being able to simply type `!tbr` and have the bot share my list in the chat. 🎉 or simply being about to type `!tbr <user>` and getting their list.

But beyond that, I envisioned a bot that could truly empower server admins and moderators by streamlining book club activities within the server. Creating events, channels, rewarding users, etc.

## Potential Features 🚀

Here's a list of potential features the bot could have:

- 📖 **Create, Share, and Manage TBRs**
- 📚 **Book summaries** (blurb, author, release date, etc.)
- 📅 **Event management** for monthly discussions
- 🏷️ **Category and channel management** for book-related topics
- 🗳️ **Manage monthly book voting using polls**
- 🏆 **Awards management** for users (e.g., best discussion contributor)
- ...and much more!

## Strengths and Weaknesses ⚖️

**Language of choice:** 🐍 **Python**

Why Python? Because it's the language I know best and feel comfortable enough with to build this bot. I might consider rebuilding it in **Go** later when I learn it, or even in JS/TS 🏗️

### Strengths ✅

This project will allow me to explore and gain experience with many new topics and tools, such as:

- ⚙️ **Coroutines, Tasks, Concurrency** (async/await)
- 🗄️ **Databases** (PostgreSQL, SQLite, MongoDB)
- 🌐 **APIs** (Creating and Consuming)
- 🎨 **Decorators** for clean and efficient code
- 📦 **Package management** and environment setup
- 📝 **Markdown** for documentation

### Weaknesses ❌

On the flip side, I've never built an application that:

- Interacts with APIs
- Uses databases
- Utilizes asynchronous programming
- Or a web-based interface

⏳ This means a lot of development time will go into **research and learning.** However, is that a bad thing? Not at all!

Although the end result might not be a huge application, the primary goal is to **learn** rather than to produce a perfect, production-ready software.

## When Do I Start? 🏁

Enough planning... it's time to get started! 🚀
