## 👋 Hey there! I'm Tom Blackburn

Just a middle-aged dude on an exciting journey of continuous learning, coding, problem-solving, and crafting beautiful things. Whether it's lines of code or tinkering with ideas sitting at my desk fueled by coffee ☕ and accompanied by my keyboard (a Unicomp Model M buckling spring 🤏)

## 🔭 **Back in my day...**  
I spent a good amount of my career as a **Project Manager** at a Robotic Process Automation (RPA) company, collaborating closely with software engineers to bring automation to life. I've done some coding before (mainly in **C#** *eurgh*) and understand many of the core concepts, but time to get see-ree-us!

---

## 🌱 **Weapon of Choice**  
Currently, my go-to language is **Python**, as I'm deeply fascinated by the world of **Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI Automation**. However, I believe in broadening my horizons, so I'm also keen on exploring other programming languages like:

- **Go** – Simple, Speedy, Sexy.
- **TypeScript** – Feed the web in me.
- **Rust** – Beast-mode activated.

## 📚 **Books I Love**  
I'm a huge reader -> stories shape us. Some of my all-time favorite fictional reads include:

- *[Words of Radiance](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17332218-words-of-radiance)* – Epic fantasy at it's best with awesome characters.
- *[The Martian](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18007564-the-martian)* – A gripping tale of survival and ingenuity.
- *[Golden Son](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18966819-golden-son)* – An absolutly epic space opera story with characters I love.
- *[The Name of the Wind](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/186074.The_Name_of_the_Wind)* – A beautifully written fantasy masterpiece, the tale of a life.
- *[The Dragonbone Chair](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/91981.The_Dragonbone_Chair)* – A classic of the genre, the father of all fantasy.
- *[Assassin's Apprentice](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77197.Assassin_s_Apprentice)* – A story filled with intrigue and magic and character-work beyond anything!

I'm always on the lookout for new book recommendations—so feel free to send some my way!
